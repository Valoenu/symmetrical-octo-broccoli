# 🌐 Bootstrap Website Project

Hi! I'm a student learning web development, and this is one of my practice projects using **Bootstrap 5**. I built a simple, responsive multi-section website to explore Bootstrap components, layout systems, and responsive design techniques.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This website is designed as a single-page layout with the following sections:
- **Hero Section** – A welcoming banner with an image and call-to-action buttons
- **Features** – A 3-column layout highlighting key features or services
- **Testimonials** – Placeholder for quotes and client images
- **Pricing Plans** – Bootstrap cards showing three different pricing tiers
- **Footer** – Navigation links and copyright

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0 (via CDN)**
- **Custom CSS** for additional styling
